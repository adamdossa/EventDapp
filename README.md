# Event SmartContract
WIP of smart contract (Ethereum / solidity) to manage ticket sales for events.

## Building

1. First run `truffle compile`, then run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts onto your network of choice (default "development").
1. Then run `truffle test` to exercise contracts.
